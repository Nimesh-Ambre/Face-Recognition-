# Face-Recognition-
Face Detection and Recognition,
The Live face file is used to detect the faces from the webcam and by using the universal 'haar cascade' file extensions we can detect the facial parameters and eye parameters as well. This code only detects the frontal face of the subjects.
FR Faces uses the test3 jpg to detect the faces of the subjects,
In this project, there are 3 types of code for 3 different environments i.e [Image, Video, Webcam]
